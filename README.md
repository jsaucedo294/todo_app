# **Todo APP** - Code Louisville 

Todo App can create new tasks and save them on a "h2" Database. This app is able to create and delete tasks, set due dates, and mark tasks as complete. I created this todo app using a java web framework called "Spring boot" which uses an ORM called "Hibernate" to convert data between the relational database and java, and a template engine called "Thymeleaf" to display content on the browser.
